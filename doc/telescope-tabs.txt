INTRODUCTION                                                  *telescope-tabs*

telescope-tabs is a small extension for telescope.nvim. It makes it more
convenient to switch between tabs in a fast way.
Additionally you can switch back to your last used tab immediately, without
having to open the telescope-picker.
Note that this extension wont work well with buffer-line extensions, as it
does not show single buffers (like :Telescope buffers does). Only "real" tabs
are displayed!

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                  *configuration*

Call the setup function with a table as the argument to override the default
configuration.

require'telescope-tabs'.setup {
    -- This function is used to convert a tab to a string that is then
    -- displayed in telescopes picker
    -- tab_id: id of the tab. This id can be passed to neovims api in order
    --         to get information about the tab.
    -- buffer_ids: A list of ids for every buffer opened in the tab. Those
    --             ids can be passed to neovims api in order to get
    --             information about the buffer.
    -- file_names: A list of names (strings) for every buffer opened in the
    --             tab.
    -- file_paths: A list of paths (strings) for every buffer opened in the
    --             tab.
    -- is_current: Boolean value, true if it is the current tab.
    --
    -- buffer_ids, file_names and file_paths contain their information in
    -- the same order. So buffer_ids[1], file_names[1] and file_paths[1]
    -- refer to the same buffer.
    entry_formatter = function(tab_id, buffer_ids, file_names, file_paths, is_current)
        local entry_string = table.concat(file_names, ', ')
        return string.format('%d: %s', tab_id, entry_string)
    end,

    -- This function is used to convert a tab to a string that is then
    -- used to sort all entries. The string is also used to determine if
    -- if a tab matches a given search query.
    -- tab_id: id of the tab. This id can be passed to neovims api in order
    --         to get information about the tab.
    -- buffer_ids: A list of ids for every buffer opened in the tab. Those
    --             ids can be passed to neovims api in order to get
    --             information about the buffer.
    -- file_names: A list of names (strings) for every buffer opened in the
    --             tab.
    -- file_paths: A list of paths (strings) for every buffer opened in the
    --             tab.
    -- is_current: Boolean value, true if it is the current tab.
    --
    -- buffer_ids, file_names and file_paths contain their information in
    -- the same order. So buffer_ids[1], file_names[1] and file_paths[1]
    -- refer to the same buffer.
    entry_ordinal = function(tab_id, buffer_ids, file_names, file_paths, is_current)
        return table.concat(file_names, ' ')
    end,

    -- This boolean value controls whether telescopes previewer is shown, or
    -- not.
    show_preview = true,

    -- These shortcuts can be pressed to close the selected tab (and all buffers
    -- opened in it). Their values have to be valid neovim-shortcuts.
    close_tab_shortcut_i = '<C-d>', -- if you're in insert mode
    close_tab_shortcut_n = 'D',     -- if you're in normal mode
}

USAGE                                                   *telescope-tabs-usage*

:Telescope telescope-tabs list_tabs                                *list_tabs*
This opens the telescope picker that displays all currently opened tabs.
You can pass arguments passed to this function in order to configure the picker
itself. See the telescope docs for more information.

:lua require('telescope-tabs').go_to_previous()                *go_to_previous*
This function opens the last used tab immediately. This works by registering an
auto-command for the 'TabEnter' event that keeps track of your tab-navigations.
So this function does not only work if you switch tabs using the picker, it
also functions just fine when navigating using neovims tab movement methods.

==============================================================================
API                                                        *telescope-tabs-api*

The available command can also be accessed from lua.

local tabs = require'telescope-tabs'

tabs.setup(opts: {table})
    See configuration

tabs.list_tabs(opts: {table})
    This opens the telescope picker that displays all currently opened tabs.
    You can pass arguments passed to this function in order to configure the
    picker itself. See the telescope docs for more information.
    opts are directly passed to telescope.

tabs.go_to_revious()
    This function opens the last used tab immediately. This works by registering
    an auto-command for the 'TabEnter' event that keeps track of your
    tab-navigations. So this function does not only work if you switch tabs using
    the picker, it also functions just fine when navigating using neovims tab
    movement methods.
